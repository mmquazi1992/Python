The hurdle challenge features walls of variable and random heights, requiring dynamic solutions.
Using while loops and conditions such as wall_in_front() and front_is_clear().
Created new functions - go_up, go_down and jump_the_hurdle to handle variable heights.
Testing code iteratively and checking for syntax errors, such as missing colons etc..
