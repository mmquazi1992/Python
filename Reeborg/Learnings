The hurdle challenge features walls of variable and random heights, requiring dynamic solutions.
Using while loops and conditions such as wall_in_front() and front_is_clear().
Modifying the jump function to handle variable heights involves nested while loops and careful use of robot movement commands.
Testing code iteratively and checking for syntax errors, such as missing colons, is crucial for successful completion.
